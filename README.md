# PDB_protein_analyzer

The project aims to analyze the protein structure obtained from the PDB database. The script is written in Python.

To get the data you need, after running the script, enter the PDB code, e.g. 1rxl, 1crn, 1a9q, 1qop, 1BKS.

The script performs a query to the PDB database and then returns the file with the data we are working on.

I used the Biopython library to obtain data and analyze it. Link: [BIOPYTHON](https://biopython.org/)

## Runtime Environment:

* WinPython version 3.7. Link: [WINPYTHON](https://winpython.github.io/)

* In "WinPython Command Prompt" we install the Biopython library: ``` pip install biopython ```

* For best results I recommend using IDE Spyder. Link: [SPYDER](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
